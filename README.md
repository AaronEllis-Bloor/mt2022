Graduate Advanced Macroeconomic Analysis - Notebooks and solutions

## Notes for TA/Instructor

* Each week's tutorial/notebook is stored in a folder called ``wx-title-of-topic``, where ``x`` is the week in which the material is first taught.
* That means the TA will cover/discuss the exercises of week ``x`` during week ``x+1``!

**Please do not redistribute any part of this material here!**
