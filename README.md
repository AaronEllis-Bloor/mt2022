## Notes for students

* Each week's tutorial/notebook is stored in a folder called ``wx-title-of-topic``, where ``x`` is the week in which the material is first taught.
* That means the Teaching Assistant (TA) and Instructor will cover/discuss the exercises of week ``x`` during the live workshop and tutorial in week ``x+1``!
