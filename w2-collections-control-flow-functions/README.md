# w2-collections-control-flow-functions

This week we take students through:

1. idea of Python program through **collections**, just like in math, we organize things in terms of sets or sets of sets;
2. **control flow**, focusing on most-used logical concepts like:
  * **conditional statements** (``if``, ``else``, ``elif``) and 
  * iterative tasks using ``for`` and ``while`` loops;
3. how to design efficient and clean code using functions: ``def`` and ``lambda``.
